# 🎉 ChefCode AI Assistant - New Features Guide

## What's New?

Three powerful improvements to make your experience even better!

---

## 1. 🎤 **Keep Talking with the Chat Microphone**

### Before:
You had to close the chat and go back to the toolbar to use voice again.

### Now:
**A big microphone button is always available in the chat!**

### How to Use:
1. Open the AI assistant (type or speak a command)
2. See the **big blue microphone button** at the bottom of the chat
3. Click it anytime to start speaking
4. The button turns **red** while listening
5. Speak your follow-up command
6. Click again to speak more!

### Example:
```
You: [Click mic] "Add 5 kg of flour"
AI: "I need the unit price..."
You: [Click mic again - no need to leave chat!] 
     "at 1.50 euros per kg"
AI: "Ready to add! Confirm?"
```

**✨ Tip:** You can have an entire conversation using just voice, without ever touching the keyboard!

## 2. 🔍 **Better Recipe Search Experience**

### What Changed:
When you search for recipes, the AI now uses the same beautiful search modal you're already familiar with!

### How It Works:
1. Say or type: **"Search pasta recipes"**
2. The AI finds recipes and opens the **web recipe modal**
3. Browse recipe cards (same interface as "Search Recipe from Web" button)
4. Click any recipe to see full details
5. Import with automatic ingredient mapping!

### Why This Matters:
- ✅ Consistent interface - no confusion
- ✅ All recipe search features in one place
- ✅ Smoother workflow
- ✅ Same beautiful design everywhere

### Try It:
```
"Find Italian recipes"
"Search for desserts"
"Look for vegan dishes"
"Find pasta recipes"
```

## 3. ✅ **Smart Validation - No More Incomplete Data**

### What's New:
The AI now ensures you provide ALL required information before adding items!

---

### 📦 **For Inventory**

#### Required Information:
- ✅ Item name
- ✅ Quantity  
- ✅ Unit
- ✅ **Price** ← NEW!

#### Example 1: Missing Price
```

AI: "📝 To add inventory, I need the unit price. 
     Please provide the missing information.
     
     Example: 'Add 10 kg of sugar at 1.20 euros per kg'"

You: "at 1.20 euros per kg"

AI: "Ready to add 10 kg of sugar at 1.20 per kg. Confirm?"
```

#### Example 2: Complete Information
```

### 🍳 **For Recipes**

     Please tell me the ingredients for this recipe.
     
     Example: 'mascarpone 500g, coffee 200ml, sugar 100g'"

You: "mascarpone 500 grams, coffee 200 ml, sugar 100 grams"

     Ingredients:
       • mascarpone: 500 g

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### Voice Commands

#### Inventory - Always Include Price:
```

## 🆘 **Common Scenarios**

### "What if I forget the price?"
No problem! The AI will ask you for it:
```
You: "Add 3 kg of potatoes"
AI: "I need the unit price..."
You: "1.50 euros"
AI: "Got it! Ready to add..."
```

### "Can I still add inventory without price?"
No - price is now mandatory to ensure accurate cost tracking for your restaurant.

### "What if I only have the recipe name?"
The AI will prompt you for ingredients:
```
